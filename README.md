#CS490 Frontend
Version 0.9
The Frontend for a CS490 Project at NJIT.

This Project is a Website that allows a professor to create a test that is based
on Python, similar to NJIT CS100. However, the test is automatically graded by
our Patented CS1000 Algorithm, to save the professor time and hassle. Once the exams have been automatically graded, he can still add comments and change the grades if he feels the grader made a mistake. 
A Professor can:

1. Add questions to a question bank
2. Search for questions by name, or question type.
3. Create a test from questions in the question bank
4. Release scores so the test can be graded
5. Add comments and alter scores

A Student can:

1. Take a test
2. View his or her grade
