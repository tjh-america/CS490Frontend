This is a login System for a CS490 Project at NJIT.

The login utilizes an AJAX post request to a PHP page, which makes a CURL post
request to a Middle and Back end page. The Middle end attempts to log into an
NJIT server and passes the Username and Password to the Backend. The Backend
attempts to log in to a MYSQL database. The results of each action are displayed
on the index page.
