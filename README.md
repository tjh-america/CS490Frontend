#CS490 Frontend
Version 0.9
The Frontend for a CS490 Project at NJIT.

This Project is a Website that allows a professor to create a test that is based
on Python, similar to NJIT CS100. However, the test is automatically graded by
our Patented CS1000 Algorithm, to save the professor time and hassle. However,
he can still add comments if he chooses.
A Professor can:

1. Add questions to a question bank
2. Search for questions by name, or question type.
3. Create a test from questions in the question bank
4. Release scores so the test can be graded
5. Add comments and alter scores

A Student can:

1. Take a test
2. View his or her grade

In the Current 0.3 Beta Version:

Professor/createQuestion.html accepts input and returns JSON

Professor/createTest.html allows professor to move questions from the question
bank to the tentative test. When submitted, the test returns JSON

Student/takeTest.html allows student to answer questions from the test.
Submitting the test returns JSON

To Do:
